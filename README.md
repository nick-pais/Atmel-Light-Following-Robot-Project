# Atmel-Light-Following-Robot-Project
Using an 8-bit Atmel Microprocessor I created a robot that measures light and will drive toward it. The system is controlled by 3 CDS sensors that measure light and use the values to triangulate the direction of travel. The robot also comes equipped with snap-action switches to act as bumpers for collision detection.
